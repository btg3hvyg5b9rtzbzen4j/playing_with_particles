# Playing with Particles

This is my playground for simulating our solar system with **realistic** distances, sizes and speeds - scaled down 50'000'000 times. Written in Rust.

Controls:

- `WASD`: Move forward/left/backward/right.
- `Space`: Move up.
- `Left Control` Move down.
- `Left Shift` Reduce movement speed to C.
- `Escape` Lock/unlock mouse for UI interaction.

Dependencies:

- `macroquad`: Rendering stuff
