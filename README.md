# Playing with Particles

This is my playground for simulating our solar system with **realistic** distances, sizes and speeds - scaled down 50'000'000 times. Written in Rust.

Controls:

- `WASD`: Move forward/left/backward/right
- `Space`: Move up
- `Left Control` Move down
- `Left Shift` Reduce speed from 20x speed of light (20c) to 1c.

Dependencies:

- `macroquad`: Rendering stuff
